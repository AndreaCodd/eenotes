This scheme can provide some computational advantages, which are not discussed here. However, the **forward Euler** scheme has a major disadvantage. Namely, depending on the  material parameters as well as the domain discretization of the spatial derivative term, the time step size $h$ needs to be chosen sufficiently small to achieve a stable temperature when progressing in time. Stability is achieved if the temperature does not grow beyond its initial bounds and becomes non-physical. The backward Euler scheme, which we use here, is unconditionally stable meaning that under the assumption of a physically correct problem set-up the temperature approximation remains physical for all time steps. The user needs to keep in mind that the discretisation error introduced by Equation (2.2) is sufficiently small, thus a good approximation of the true temperature is computed.

Besides the spatial dimensions this function requires to specify the number of elements or cells to be used along the length and height, see Figure (2.3). Any spatially distributed value and the PDE is represented in discrete form using this element representation. Therefore we will have access to an approximation of the true PDE solution only. The quality of the approximation depends - besides other factors - mainly on the number of elements being used. In fact, the  approximation becomes better when more elements are used. However, computational cost grows with the number of\n",

    "In general, one can think about a domain object as a composition of nodes and elements. As shown in Figure (2.3), an element is defined by the nodes that are used to describe its vertices. To represent spatially distributed values the user can use the values at the nodes, at the elements in the interior of the domain or at the elements located on the surface of the domain. The different approach used to represent values is called **functionspace** and is attached to all objects in *escript* representing a spatially distributed value such as the solution of a PDE. The three function spaces we use at the moment are\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. the nodes, called by `ContinuousFunction(domain)`;\n",
    "  2. the elements/cells, called by `Function(domain)`; and\n",
    "  3. the boundary, called by `FunctionOnBoundary(domain)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function space object such as `ContinuousFunction(domain)` has the method `getX` attached to it. This method returns the location of the so-called **sample points** used to represent values of the particular function space. So the call `ContinuousFunction(domain).getX()` will return the coordinates of the nodes used to describe the domain while `Function(domain).getX()` returns the coordinates of numerical integration points within elements, see Figure (2.3). \n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction between different representations of spatially distributed values is important in order to be able to vary the degrees of smoothness in a PDE problem. The coefficients of a PDE do not need to be continuous, thus this qualifies as a `Function()` type. On the other hand a temperature distribution must be continuous and needs to be represented with a `ContinuousFunction()` function space. An influx may only be defined at the boundary and is therefore a `FunctionOnBoundary()` object. *escript* allows certain transformations of the function spaces. A\n",

When defining the size of our problem it will help us determine appropriate values for our model arguments. If we make our dimensions large but our step sizes very small we increase the accuracy of our solution. Unfortunately we also increase the number of calculations that must be solved per time step.

    "In the iron rod model we want to keep the initial temperature $T_0$ on the left side of the domain constant with time.  This implies that when we solve the PDE Equation (2.5), the solution must have the value $T_0$ on the left hand side of the domain. As mentioned already in Section 2.1.3 where we discussed boundary conditions, this kind of scenario can be expressed using a `Dirichlet boundary condition`. Some people also use the term `constraint` for the PDE. \n",

In *escript* we use $q$ and $r$ to define the Dirichlet boundary conditions for a PDE. The solution $u$ of the PDE is set to $r$ for all sample points where $q$ has a positive value.

    "The total energy over time is shown in above figure. As heat is transferred into the rod by the heater the total energy is growing over time but reaches a plateau when the temperature is constant in the rod, see Figure (2.8). You will notice that the time scale of this model is several order of magnitudes faster than for the granite rock problem due to the different length scale and material parameters. In practice it can take a few model runs before the right time scale has been chosen. An estimate of the time scale for a diffusion problem is given by the formula $\\frac{\\rho c_{p} L_{0}^2}{4 \\kappa}$, see [reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fick\\%27s_laws_of_diffusion).\n",
