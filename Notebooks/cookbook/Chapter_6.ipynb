    "We will now expand upon the previous chapter by introducing a vector form of the wave equation. This means\n",
    "that the waves will have not only a scalar magnitude as for the pressure wave solution, but also a direction. This type of scenario is apparent in wave types that exhibit compressional and transverse particle motion. An example of this would be seismic waves. Wave propagation in the earth can be described by the elastic wave equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\rho \\frac{\\partial^{2}u_{i}}{\\partial t^2} - \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_{j}} = 0\n",
    "  \\tag{6.1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the stress given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\sigma _{ij} = \\lambda u_{k,k} \\delta_{ij} + \\mu (u_{i,j} + u_{j,i})\n",
    "  \\tag{6.2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "and $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ represent Lame's parameters. Specifically for seismic waves, $\\mu$ is the propagation materials shear modulus. In a similar process to the previous chapter, we will use the acceleration solution to solve this PDE. By substituting $a$ directly for $\\frac{\\partial^{2}u_{i}}{\\partial t^2}$ we can derive the\n",
    "acceleration solution. Using $a$ we can see that Equation (6.1) becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "  \\rho a_{i} - \\frac{\\partial\\sigma_{ij}}{\\partial x_{j}} = 0\n",
    "  \\tag{6.3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the problem will be solved for acceleration and then converted to displacement using the backwards difference approximation as for the acoustic example in the previous chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now the stress $\\sigma$. One can see that the stress consists of two distinct terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\lambda u_{k,k} \\delta_{ij}\n",
    "  \\tag{6.4a}\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\mu (u_{i,j} + u_{j,i})\n",
    "  \\tag{6.4b}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "One simply recognizes in Equation (6.4a) that $u_{k,k}$ is the trace of the displacement solution and that $\\delta_{ij}$ is the kronecker delta function with dimensions equivalent to $u$. The second term Equation (6.4b) is the sum of $u$ with its own transpose. Putting these facts together we see that the spatial differential of the stress is given by the gradient of $u$ and the aforementioned operations. This value is then submitted\n",
